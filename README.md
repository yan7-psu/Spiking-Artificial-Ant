# Spiking Artifical Ant

This repo looks at Koza's Artificial Ant problem and attempts to solve the Santa Fe Trail with a Spiking Neural network.

# Network Architecture

The Spiking Neural network is comprised of SLSTM neurons, which allows the network to have memory. The network is comprised of a input layer, 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer.
The input layer consists for 69 neuron which represent the state of the ant. The output layer conists of 3 neurons which map to an action that the ant can take.
